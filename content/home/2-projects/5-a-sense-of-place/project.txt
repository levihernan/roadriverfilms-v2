Text: 

In the episodic documentary "A Sense of Place",  Iranian directors* each examine a place in Iran, Germany, or France. The places and the stories the filmmakers tell about entering into dialogue with each other. It is about living conditions in today's Iran, about social and economic conditions, but also about identities in exile, and about places of longing. The project was shaped by the collaboration of Wim Wenders and Andr√© Rigaut. 

"Places. We owe them respect, they have a deeper meaning for us than just being there. They accompany us in silence. They shape our lives and our history. They are our stage." 
Wim Wenders
 
In cooperation with Wim Wenders Stiftung, Pejman Foundation, and La Onda Productions
