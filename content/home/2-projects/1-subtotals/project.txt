Title: Subtotals

**Synopsis:**

Inspired by a short story of the same title by Gregory Burnham and the novel “Autoportrait'' by Édouard Levé, “Subtotals” is a meditation on the uncertainties of a life that doesn’t hand you any bills. It is an essay wholly composed of 8mm home movies of Iranian people, about an impossible attempt at accounting for one’s life’s products. Have you kept an account of your gray hair? Of the number of houses you have owned or rented? Of the number of kisses you have exchanged? Of the number of times you have flown in dreams? You may not have. It makes no real difference in a life lived beyond numbers.
