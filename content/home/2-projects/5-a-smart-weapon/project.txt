A Smart Weapon is a mash-up film where human and artificial intelligence naturally embraces each other in an investigation into the hidden face of one of the pillars of the Cuban revolution and its healthcare system. Banishings, controlling methods, the inner workings of state business and a post-pandemic era that is just beginning to settle down and come together for a reflective, artistic, political dialogue that tries to decipher what lies behind the myth built as the Cuban Revolution.
