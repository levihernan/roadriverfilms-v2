Text: 

This story world reminds us of how we inhabit digital space and travel in the ocean of data. We are no longer defined by realism, but by digital experiences that bring us together and also create new boundaries and misunderstandings. Digitality is increasingly determining our living space and is now closely linked to our existence. We are interested in how this digitality can be also cinematographic, and habitat for storytelling and intimacy. We want to create new visual impressions in cinema that stimulate non-established, forward-looking discourses.
